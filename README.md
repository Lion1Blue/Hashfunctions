# Hashfunctions

## Task


## [Definition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function)
A hash function is any function that can be used to map data of arbitrary size to fixed-size values. The values returned by a hash function are called hash values, hash codes, digests, or simply hashes. It is a one-way function, that is, a function for which is practically infeasible to invert or reverse the computation. Ideally, the only way to find a message that produces a given hash is to attempt a brute-force search of possible inputs to see if they produce a match
